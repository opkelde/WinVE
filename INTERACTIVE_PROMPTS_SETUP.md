# 🎯 WinVE Interactive Prompts - Complete Setup Guide

Transform your Home Assistant into a truly conversational smart home! WinVE can now receive prompts from HA, ask questions via TTS, listen for voice responses, and execute actions based on what you say.

## 🚀 How It Works

**The Magic Flow:**
1. 🏠 **HA detects event** (door opens, motion detected, etc.)
2. 🔗 **HA sends HTTP request** to WinVE with question + AI context instructions
3. 🎤 **WinVE asks user** the question via TTS 
4. 🗣️ **User responds** with voice
5. 🧠 **WinVE sends to HA AI** user response + context instructions
6. ✅ **HA AI understands context** and executes appropriate action

**Example:**
> Door opens → HA sends: *"Welcome home! Want lights and coffee?" + context: "User arriving home, activate arrival routine if they agree"* → WinVE asks → You: *"Yes please!"* → WinVE sends: *"Context: User arriving home, activate arrival routine if they agree. User said: Yes please"* → HA AI turns on lights and starts coffee

## 🏠 Home Assistant Configuration

### Step 1: Add REST Command

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rest_command:
  winve_prompt:
    url: "http://192.168.1.100:8766/prompt"  # Change IP to your WinVE machine
    method: POST
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    payload: |
      {
        "message": "{{ message }}",
        "context": "{{ context }}",
        "timeout": {{ timeout | default(15) }},
        "wait_for_response": {{ wait_for_response | default(true) | lower }}
      }
```

### Parameters

- **message**: The text WinVE should speak
- **context**: Context information for the conversation (optional)  
- **timeout**: How long to wait for user response in seconds (default: 15)
- **wait_for_response**: Whether to wait for user input after TTS (default: true)
  - `true`: Normal interactive mode - plays TTS then waits for voice response
  - `false`: TTS-only mode - plays TTS then ends (for announcements)

          timeout: 20
```

#### ⚡ Energy Management
```yaml
  - alias: "⚡ Smart Energy Alert"
    description: "Intelligent power usage optimization"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.current_power_usage
        above: 3000
        for: "00:05:00"
    action:
      - service: rest_command.winve_prompt
        data:
          message: >
            High energy usage detected! Currently consuming {{ states('sensor.current_power_usage') }}W.
            The main culprits are heating and entertainment system.
            Should I optimize power usage by adjusting climate and non-essential devices?
          context: "High energy usage detected. If user agrees to optimize, reduce climate temperature by 2°C, turn off non-essential devices and lights to save power"
          timeout: 18
```

### Step 3: How AI Processes Responses

When user responds, WinVE sends to HA AI:
*"Context: [your context instructions]. User said: [user voice response]"*

The AI automatically understands what to do based on context and executes appropriate actions. No additional scripts needed - HA AI handles everything!

**Example:**
- WinVE sends: *"Context: User is leaving home. If they want secure departure mode, turn off all lights. User said: Yes please"*
- HA AI automatically turns off lights, arms security, etc.


## 🧠 How Context Works in Practice

**The AI automatically understands context!** No complex configuration needed.

**Examples of what WinVE sends to HA AI:**

1. **Morning Routine:**
   - *"Context: User is waking up in the morning. If they agree, activate morning routine: turn on coffee maker, start news briefing, and set optimal lighting. User said: Yes please"*
   - HA AI → Turns on coffee, starts news, optimizes lighting

2. **Energy Optimization:**
   - *"Context: High energy usage detected. If user agrees to optimize, reduce climate temperature by 2°C, turn off non-essential devices. User said: Do it"*
   - HA AI → Reduces temperature, turns off gaming PC and entertainment center

3. **Departure Security:**
   - *"Context: User is leaving home. If they want secure departure mode, turn off all lights and devices, arm security system. User said: Secure everything"*
   - HA AI → Executes full departure sequence

**The beauty:** HA AI understands natural language context instructions and user responses automatically!

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Quick API Test
```bash
# Test if WinVE is listening
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.100:8766/prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "message": "This is a test. Are you ready for some awesome home automation?",
    "context": "This is a connection test. If user responds positively, confirm the system is working properly",
    "timeout": 15
  }'
```

### HA Developer Tools Test
Go to `Developer Tools > Services`:

**Service:** `rest_command.winve_prompt`

**Data:**
```yaml
message: "Testing the connection. Can you hear me and respond with your voice?"
context: "This is a connection test. If user responds, confirm that WinVE and Home Assistant are communicating properly"
timeout: 20
```
